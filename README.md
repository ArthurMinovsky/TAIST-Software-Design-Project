# G4: Department Store Smart Parking System : )

## Objectives
* Assemble harware component for controlling parking gate
* Applied Internet of Things Concept to improve parking system
* Integate Artificial Intelligenct to make smart parking system

## Scope
1. Concepts: 
   * Department Store Smart Parking System

## User stories and acceptance criteria
1. As a **customer**, I want to **get a parking stall without driving around the parking lot** so that **I can save time and energy looking for one**.
   * Scenario: **customer visits**, given **there is a parking stall**, when **the car pulls up in front of the gate**, then **the parking stall number is assigned (Push Style), and the gate opens**.
   * Scenario: **customer visits**, given **there is NO parking stall**, when **the car pulls up in front of the gate, then there will be a sign saying ‘FULL’, and the gate will not open**.
2. As an **owner**, I want to **see how many cars are in the parking lot** so that **I can understand the current status**.
	* Scenario: **Density**, given **RFID tags are assigned**, when **checked**, then **the percentage occupied is displayed**.
	* Scenario: **Income**, given **the duration of parked cars**, when **checked**, then **the realized and unrealized income is reported**.
	>Realized income is when the customer has already paid the fee for their duration parked and out of the system. <br />
	>Unrealized income is when the customer is still in the system, and the calculation is done through the duration parked up until now.
3.	As an **owner**, I want to **know historical data of how long and how many customers used the parking lot** so that **I can analyze the data for prediction**.
	* Scenario: **Utilization**, given **the percentage of stall occupied is calculated**, when **the number is low**, **then the space can be allocated for other purposes**.
	* Scenario: **Advance Booking**, given **the statistic of stall occupied is determined**, when **the customer wants to know space availability in advance**, then **I can tell whether there will be available space or not**.
	* Scenario: **Operation Management**, given **there are databases of customer behavior when the statistic of customer behavior is determined**, then **the department can adjust their operation like opening/closing time, employees hired, and facility investment accordingly**.

## Software architecture
### System Structure:
* Software system consists of three software stacks for detecting cars by IR sensor, parking ID collection data (ID, Status, Time), and Mobile UI to show the parking ID in LINE application.
